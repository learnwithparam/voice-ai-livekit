LLM Provider
============

🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
This module teaches you how to build a flexible AI provider system:

1. Abstraction Patterns - How to design interchangeable components
2. Provider Pattern - How to support multiple AI services
3. API Compatibility - How OpenAI-compatible APIs work
4. Streaming - How to implement real-time text generation
5. Factory Pattern - How to select providers based on configuration

📚 LEARNING FLOW:
Follow this code from top to bottom:

Step 1: Abstract Base Class - Define the contract all providers must follow
Step 2: Cloud Providers - Learn how to integrate commercial AI APIs
Step 3: Factory Pattern - Automatically select the right provider

Key Concept: This uses the "Provider Pattern" - all providers implement
the same interface, so you can swap them without changing your code!

"""
Post-processing for streaming chunks to fix spacing and punctuation issues.

Some LLM providers return chunks without proper spacing, especially:
- Numbers followed by words: "123abc" -> "123 abc"
- Punctuation followed by words: ".next" -> ". next"
- Missing spaces after punctuation: "word,word" -> "word, word"

"""
What is an Abstract Base Class?
- Defines the "contract" that all providers must follow
- Ensures all providers have the same methods (generate_text, generate_stream)
- Makes code interchangeable - you can swap providers easily

Benefits:
- Type safety: Code expects specific methods
- Consistency: All providers work the same way
- Flexibility: Add new providers without breaking existing code

After reading this code, you should understand:

✓ How abstraction works (ABC base class)
✓ How to integrate cloud AI APIs (Gemini, OpenAI, FireworksAI)
✓ How OpenAI-compatible APIs work (OpenRouter example)
✓ How the Factory Pattern simplifies provider selection
✓ How streaming works across different providers
✓ The benefits of API compatibility

Next Steps:
1. Try different providers and compare results
2. Experiment with different models on OpenRouter
3. Add a new provider (e.g., Anthropic Claude directly)
4. Understand how OpenAI-compatible APIs reduce code duplication
5. Learn about API standardization benefits

Questions to Consider:
- Why is OpenAI-compatible API format useful?
- What are the advantages of using OpenRouter vs direct APIs?
- How does the Factory Pattern make code more maintainable?
- How would you add caching to reduce API costs?
- What security considerations exist for API keys?
